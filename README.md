# Coalescence® Framework

### Introduction
Coalescence® is a new organizational operating system (OS) for structuring, governing, and running purpose-driven organizations. Coalescence utilizes three powerful governing principles; consent, representation, and transparency, to drive peak organizational performance.

The **Coalescence Framework** incorporates a powerful, nested set of core, governance, and performance principles along with flexible structural design elements (circles, workgroups, and roles) that enable organizations to take on any form or scale.

Also included are core decision-making methods, meeting practices, shared-language definitions, and a foundational legal architecture that can be fully incorporated and preserved within most organizational forms via bylaws and operating agreements.

The Framework is designed to be extensible - which allows for customizable templates and add-on components to enable flexible organizational deployment, development, and scaling.
